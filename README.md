## Specifications :

## Description : 
This is a basic parser i made that can read a file, parse it, and execute function with arguments in it.
##### Current functions :
 - ADD (Adds arg A and B, store at an address in the registers/memory, the address being arg C)
 - SUB (Subtracts arg A and B, store at an address in the registers/memory, the address being arg C)
 - MULT (Multiplies arg A and B, store at an address in the registers/memory, the address being arg C)
 - DIV (Divides arg A and B, store at an address in the registers/memory, the address being arg C)
 - ECHO (Prints the value at an adress in registers/memory, the address being arg A)
 
##### To know :
 - Memory Adress is between 0 and 1024
 - One function per line
 - I think that it.
